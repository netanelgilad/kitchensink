# Project Files
<important>
These files are guranteed to exist, not need to check their existence, you can just read them when needed.
</important>
the src folder has:
* `pages` folder, containing astro pages. <important>Do not place astro components here, they'll be treated as pages</important>
* `layouts` folder, containing layout astro components used across the project pages.
    * `layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - The base layout shared BY ALL PAGES. Contains the most basic setup for importing global css and rendering the `html` element, has 2 slots: `head` and `body`. Also accepts optional `bodyProps` that will be applied to the body element. Use the layout like so:
* `components` folder, containting astro components. 
```astro
---
// import BaseLayout
---
<BaseLayout bodyProps={{ class: "min-h-screen bg-gray-100" }}>
    <Fragment slot="head">
        <!-- head content here -->
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="body">
        <!-- body content here -->
    </Fragment>
</BaseLayout>
```
The contents of `BaseLayout.astro`:
```astro
---
import "../styles/global.css";
type Props = {
    bodyProps: astroHTML.JSX.HTMLAttributes;
};
---

<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <slot name="head" />
    </head>
    <body {...Astro.props.bodyProps}>
        <slot name="body" />
    </body>
</html>
```
* `styles/global.css` - The global css that also imports tailwind.
