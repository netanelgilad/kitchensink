_**User**_

in @DocsMode.tsx lets add small idnicator on teh docs button when there are headless components on the page

I'll add a small indicator to the docs button that shows when there are headless components on the page, even when not in docs mode. This will help users know there are components to explore.

Perfect! I've updated the docs button to show a small indicator whenever there are headless components on the page. Here's what changed:

1. **Always visible**: The indicator now shows regardless of whether docs mode is active or not
2. **Visual distinction**: 
   - When **not in docs mode**: Orange background with a pulsing animation to draw attention
   - When **in docs mode**: Blue background (as before) without animation
3. **Smooth transition**: Added transition classes for smooth color changes when toggling modes

Now users will see an orange, pulsing indicator with the component count on the docs button whenever there are headless components available on the page, making it clear that there's something to explore even before entering docs mode.

no need to have it blinking, make it a bit smaller

Perfect! I've made the indicator smaller and removed the blinking animation:

1. **Removed animation**: No more `animate-pulse` class
2. **Made it smaller**: Changed from `w-6 h-6` to `w-5 h-5`
3. **Adjusted positioning**: Changed from `-bottom-2 -right-2` to `-bottom-1 -right-1` to better position the smaller indicator

Now the indicator is more subtle - it's smaller and doesn't blink, but still clearly shows the orange color when not in docs mode and blue when in docs mode.

when in docs mode and a dialog is open, the components menu and what s on this page doesn't show on top of the dialog backdrop

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right! The docs floating menu is getting hidden behind dialog backdrops because of z-index layering. I need to increase the z-index of the `DocsFloatingMenu` to ensure it appears on top of dialogs.

---

Perfect! I've increased the z-index of the `DocsFloatingMenu` from `z-40` to `z-[100]` to ensure it appears above dialog backdrops and other overlay elements. 

Now when you have docs mode active and a dialog is open, both the "What's on this page" section and the "Components" menu will remain visible and accessible on top of the dialog backdrop.
