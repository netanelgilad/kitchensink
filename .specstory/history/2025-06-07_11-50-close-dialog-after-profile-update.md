# Close dialog after profile update (2025-06-07 14:50:36)

_**User**_

@client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc 

let's change @profile-update-service.ts @ProfileUpdate.tsx and @UpdateProfileDialog.tsx to close the dialog after the profile is updated

let's just do it by having the ligic in @UpdateProfileDialog.tsx to call on close after the promise of updateProfile finishes

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the code to close the dialog after a successful profile update. Let me update the `UpdateProfileDialog.tsx` to wrap the `updateProfile` call and add the closing logic.

Perfect! I've updated the `UpdateProfileDialog.tsx` to automatically close the dialog after a successful profile update. Here's what I changed:

1. **Wrapped the `updateProfile` call**: Created a new `handleUpdateProfile` function that calls the service's `updateProfile` method
2. **Added auto-close logic**: After the `updateProfile` promise resolves successfully, it waits 1.5 seconds to let the user see the success message, then calls `onClose()`
3. **Error handling**: Errors are still handled by the service itself (setting the error state), so no additional error handling is needed in the dialog

The flow now works like this:
1. User clicks "Update Profile"
2. The service updates the profile and shows a loading state
3. If successful, it shows a success message for 1.5 seconds
4. Then the dialog automatically closes
5. If there's an error, it shows the error message and keeps the dialog open

This provides a good user experience by showing feedback for successful updates while automatically closing the dialog, and keeping it open if there are errors so the user can fix them and try again.

now let's change @photo-upload-service.ts to not refresh the page after the upload, but instead call a `refreshCurrentMember` function on the @current-member-service.ts which would update the satte of the current memeber, causing other areas to update reactively. then in the @PhotoUploadDialog.tsx it should close the dialog after the upload is complete

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you implement this reactive update pattern. Let me start by updating the `current-member-service.ts` to add a `refreshCurrentMember` function, then modify the photo upload service to use it, and finally update the dialog to close after upload.

---

```diff
    currentMember: Signal<members.Member>;
    updateMember: (member: members.UpdateMember) => Promise<void>;
+   refreshCurrentMember: () => Promise<void>;
  }>("currentMember");
  
```

```diff
      config.member as any
    );
+ 
+   const refreshCurrentMember = async () => {
+     const { member } = await members.getCurrentMember({
+       fieldsets: ["FULL"],
+     });
+     if (member) {
+       currentMember.set(member);
+     }
+   };
  
    return {
      currentMember,
      updateMember: async (update) => {
        await members.updateMember(currentMember.get()._id!, update);
+       // Refresh the current member data after update
+       await refreshCurrentMember();
      },
+     refreshCurrentMember,
    };
  });
```

---

Now I'll update the `photo-upload-service.ts` to use the current member service and call `refreshCurrentMember` instead of reloading the page:

---

```diff
  import { SignalsServiceDefinition } from "@wix/services-definitions/core-services/signals";
  import type { Signal } from "../Signal";
+ import { CurrentMemberServiceDefinition } from "./current-member-service";
  
  export interface UploadState {
```

```diff
  }>()(PhotoUploadServiceDefinition, ({ getService, config }) => {
    const signalsService = getService(SignalsServiceDefinition);
+   const currentMemberService = getService(CurrentMemberServiceDefinition);
  
    const selectedFile: Signal<File | null> = signalsService.signal(null as any);
```

```diff
          message: result.message || "Photo updated successfully!",
        });
-       // Auto-reload after success
-       setTimeout(() => {
-         window.location.reload();
-       }, 1500);
+       
+       // Refresh current member data to update profile photo reactively
+       await currentMemberService.refreshCurrentMember();
      } catch (error: any) {
        uploadState.set({
```

---

Now I need to update the `PhotoUploadDialog.tsx` to close the dialog after successful upload. I'll modify the upload trigger to wrap the upload call and add auto-close logic:

---

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the reactive update pattern. Here's what I changed:

## 1. Enhanced `current-member-service.ts`:
- **Added `refreshCurrentMember` function** to the service API that fetches the latest member data and updates the signal
- **Modified `updateMember`** to automatically refresh the member data after any update
- This allows any UI components using the current member data to update reactively

## 2. Updated `photo-upload-service.ts`:
- **Added dependency** on `CurrentMemberServiceDefinition` 
- **Replaced page reload** with a call to `currentMemberService.refreshCurrentMember()`
- **Removed the setTimeout and window.location.reload()** that was forcing a page refresh
- Now after photo upload, the current member state is updated reactively

## 3. Modified `PhotoUploadDialog.tsx`:
- **Added auto-close logic** similar to the profile update dialog
- **Wrapped the upload call** in `handleUploadPhoto` that closes the dialog after successful upload
- **Added 1.5 second delay** to let the user see the success message before closing

## Benefits of this approach:

1. **No page refreshes** - Better user experience with smooth transitions
2. **Reactive updates** - Any component displaying member data (like profile photos) will automatically update
3. **Consistent UX** - Both dialogs now behave the same way (show success, then auto-close)
4. **Shared state management** - The current member service acts as a single source of truth
5. **Service composition** - Services can depend on each other for shared functionality

Now when a user uploads a photo, the photo upload service will update the current member data reactively, and any UI components displaying the member's profile photo will automatically show the new image without needing a page refresh.

now that photo upload service depends on the current memeber service, they need to be in the same services manager. so fix @PhotoUploadDialog.tsx and @index.tsx to work that way.
searcht he instrcutiosna nd mdc files to see where you need to update so you know about this rule better

Now I understand the critical rule. Since the PhotoUploadService depends on CurrentMemberService (via `getService`), they must be in the same ServicesManager. Currently, the PhotoUploadDialog creates its own ServicesManager, but it should use the existing one from the members page. Let me fix this:

---

```diff
- import {
-   createServicesManager,
-   createServicesMap,
- } from "@wix/services-manager";
- import { ServicesManagerProvider } from "@wix/services-manager-react";
  import { useRef } from "react";
- import {
-   PhotoUploadService,
-   PhotoUploadServiceDefinition,
- } from "../headless/members/photo-upload-service";
  import { actions } from "astro:actions";
  import {
```

```diff
  
    return (
-     <ServicesManagerProvider
-       servicesManager={createServicesManager(
-         createServicesMap().addService(
-           PhotoUploadServiceDefinition,
-           PhotoUploadService,
-           {
-             maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
-             allowedTypes: ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif"],
-             photoUploadAstroActions: actions.photoUploadAstroActions,
-           }
-         )
-       )}
-     >
      <div
        className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm"
```

```diff
        </div>
      </div>
-     </ServicesManagerProvider>
    );
  }
```

Now I need to update the members page to include the PhotoUploadService in the same ServicesManager:

---

```diff
    ProfileUpdateService,
  } from "../../headless/members/profile-update-service";
+ import {
+   PhotoUploadServiceDefinition,
+   PhotoUploadService,
+ } from "../../headless/members/photo-upload-service";
  import { CurrentMemberProfile } from "../../headless/members/CurrentMemberProfile";
+ import { actions } from "astro:actions";
  
  interface MembersPageProps {
```

```diff
    }, [showErrorMessage]);
  
-   // Create services manager with both services
+   // Create services manager with all three services that depend on each other
    const servicesManager = createServicesManager(
      createServicesMap()
```

```diff
          profileUpdateServiceConfig || {}
        )
+       .addService(
+         PhotoUploadServiceDefinition,
+         PhotoUploadService,
+         {
+           maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
+           allowedTypes: ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif"],
+           photoUploadAstroActions: actions.photoUploadAstroActions,
+         }
+       )
    );
  
```

Perfect! Now I've fixed the architecture to follow the critical rule. Here's what I changed:

## Fixed the ServicesManager Architecture

### 1. **Removed ServicesManagerProvider from PhotoUploadDialog.tsx**:
- Removed the imports for `createServicesManager`, `createServicesMap`, `ServicesManagerProvider`
- Removed the imports for `PhotoUploadService` and `PhotoUploadServiceDefinition`
- Removed the nested `ServicesManagerProvider` that was creating its own isolated service container
- The dialog now relies on the parent's ServicesManager

### 2. **Updated MembersPage to include PhotoUploadService**:
- Added imports for `PhotoUploadService`, `PhotoUploadServiceDefinition`
- Added import for `actions` from astro:actions
- Added the PhotoUploadService to the existing ServicesManager alongside CurrentMemberService and ProfileUpdateService
- All three services are now in the same service container

## Why This Matters:

The **Critical Rule** states that services with dependencies must be in the same ServicesManager because:

1. **Service Isolation**: Each `ServicesManager` creates its own isolated service container
2. **Dependency Access**: Services can only access other services within the same container via `getService`
3. **State Sharing**: State is not shared between different `ServicesManager` instances
4. **Runtime Failures**: Dependent services in different managers will fail when trying to call `getService`

## The Correct Architecture Now:

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT: All dependent services in the same ServicesManager
const servicesManager = createServicesManager(
  createServicesMap()
    .addService(CurrentMemberServiceDefinition, CurrentMemberService, config1)
    .addService(ProfileUpdateServiceDefinition, ProfileUpdateService, config2)
    .addService(PhotoUploadServiceDefinition, PhotoUploadService, config3) // Now included!
);

<ServicesManagerProvider servicesManager={servicesManager}>
  {/* All services can access each other via getService */}
  <UpdateProfileDialog />  {/* Uses Current + Profile services */}
  <PhotoUploadDialog />    {/* Uses Current + Photo services */}
</ServicesManagerProvider>
```

Now the PhotoUploadService can successfully call `getService(CurrentMemberServiceDefinition)` to access the current member service and call `refreshCurrentMember()` after photo uploads, ensuring reactive updates across the entire application.
