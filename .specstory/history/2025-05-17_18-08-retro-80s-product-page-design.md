_**Assistant**_

Let me build a retro 80's style product page for you. I'll first check if the directory structure exists.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/pages â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `index.astro` |

</details>

---

Now I'll check if the products directory exists:

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/Users/netanelg/Development/kitchensink/src/pages/products'

---

I need to create the products directory and the product page. First, let's verify the template file exists:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory .cursor/rules/fixtures â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `astro-syntax.astro` |

</details>

---

Great! I'll first create the products directory and then create the product page:

---

```bash
mkdir -p src/pages/products
```

```
?âžœ  kitchensink git:(main) ?âœ— 

```

---

Now I'll copy the template file and create our 80's style product page:

---

```bash
cp .cursor/rules/fixtures/astro-syntax.astro 'src/pages/products/[slug].astro'
```

```
?âžœ  kitchensink git:(main) ?âœ— 

```

---

Now I'll edit the product page to implement our retro 80's style:

---

Read file: src/pages/products/[slug].astro

---

Let's check the BaseLayout:

---

Read file: src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro

---

Let's examine what product data we'll be working with:
