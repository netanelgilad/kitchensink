Let me find the project.mdc file to update the BaseLayout usage instructions.

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "project.mdc" â€¢ **1** results</summary>

Let me read the current contents of the project.mdc file:

---

Read file: /Users/netanelg/Development/kitchensink/.cursor/rules/project.mdc

---

Now I need to update the project.mdc file with the correct BaseLayout.astro usage instructions. The current BaseLayout accepts bodyProps that can be passed to the body element.

---

```diff
  * `pages` folder, containing astro pages.
  * `layouts` folder, containing layout astro components used across the project pages.
-     * `layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - The base layout shared BY ALL PAGES. Contains the most basic setup for importing global css and rendering the `html` element, has 2 slots: `head` and `body`. Use the layout like so:
+     * `layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - The base layout shared BY ALL PAGES. Contains the most basic setup for importing global css and rendering the `html` element, has 2 slots: `head` and `body`. Also accepts optional `bodyProps` that will be applied to the body element. Use the layout like so:
  ```astro

+ // Optional bodyProps can be passed to the layout
+ const bodyProps = { class: "min-h-screen bg-gray-100" };
  ---
- <BaseLayout>
+ <BaseLayout bodyProps={bodyProps}>
      <head slot="head">
          <!-- head content here -->
```

```diff
  ---
  import "../styles/global.css";
+ type Props = {
+     bodyProps: astroHTML.JSX.HTMLAttributes;
+ };
  ---
+ 
+ <!doctype html>
  <html>
+     <head>
+         <meta charset="utf-8" />
+         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
          <slot name="head" />
+     </head>
+     <body {...Astro.props.bodyProps}>
          <slot name="body" />
+     </body>
  </html>
  ```
```

I've updated the project.mdc file with the correct BaseLayout.astro usage instructions. The updated instructions now:

1. Mention that BaseLayout accepts optional `bodyProps` that get applied to the body element
2. Include an example of how to pass these props (with a Tailwind class example)
3. Show the complete current implementation of BaseLayout including:
   - The Props type definition
   - Proper doctype and meta tags
   - How the bodyProps get applied using the spread operator

This should help users understand how to properly use the BaseLayout component with its current implementation.
