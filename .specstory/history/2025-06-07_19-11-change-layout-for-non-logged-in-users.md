# Change layout for non-logged-in users (2025-06-07 22:11:32)

_**User**_

@index.tsx let's change the layout when not logged in to have the sign in panel in the middle and no second panel at all

I'll modify the layout to show a centered sign-in panel when not logged in, and remove the second panel entirely for that state.

Perfect! I've successfully modified the layout to conditionally render based on the user's login status:

## Changes Made:

1. **When logged in (`userIsLoggedIn === true`)**: 
   - Maintains the original two-panel layout with the profile panel on the left and "Coming Soon" panel on the right
   - Uses `flex min-h-screen p-6 gap-6` for the side-by-side layout

2. **When not logged in (`userIsLoggedIn === false`)**:
   - Shows only a single centered sign-in panel
   - Uses `flex min-h-screen p-6 items-center justify-center` to center the panel
   - Completely removes the right panel ("Coming Soon" content)
   - The sign-in panel maintains the same styling and functionality but is now centered on the screen

The layout now provides a cleaner, more focused experience for non-logged-in users with the sign-in panel prominently centered, while preserving the full dashboard experience for logged-in members.
