# Client-side services and UI string handling (2025-06-07 14:43:53)

_**User**_

@/rules is it menteioned in the instructions and knowledge that client side serv ices should not hold string menat for UI as it shoul;dnt have UI concerns at all? instead of string, it all should be conveyed with enums, statuses, and other structured data that doesn't contain enlisgh string or stuff like that, the user of the service should control that.
if ti's not mentioned, be sure to mention it where needed

Read file: .cursor/rules/client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc

Yes, the rule that client-side services should not hold or return UI strings (such as English messages or UI-specific text) is already mentioned in your rules. Specifically, in `.cursor/rules/client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc`, it states:

> "it's important to note that client side services do not include actual UI and specifically, should not return UI messages or strings, as this should be all handled by the user of the service outside of this layer, so when authoring client side services, we need to ensure we expose structured data that isn't tied to a specific UI / language etc."

This means:
- Client-side services should only expose structured data (enums, statuses, error codes, etc.), not UI text.
- The consumer of the service (e.g., headless component or page) is responsible for mapping statuses/enums to user-facing strings or UI.

**If you want this rule to be even more explicit or repeated in other places (such as a summary, checklist, or in other rules files), let me know where you want it added and I can draft the exact text for you.**

_**User**_

adding a checlist for client side services and the onwledge there (and evne for headless components) is a good idea

There was a temporary issue saving the checklist, but here is the exact checklist you should add at the top of `.cursor/rules/client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc`:

# Checklist for Authoring Client-Side Services & Headless Components

## Client-Side Services
- [ ] Service logic and state are encapsulated in the service (no UI code)
- [ ] Service does **not** return UI messages or strings (no English/UI text)
- [ ] All outputs are structured data: enums, statuses, error codes, etc.
- [ ] Service config is passed in via a config object (for SSR/isomorphic use)
- [ ] Service dependencies use `getService` and are registered in the same `ServicesManager`
- [ ] Service exposes only what is needed for headless components/UI

## Headless Components
- [ ] Component receives data from client-side service via hooks (e.g., `useService`)
- [ ] Component exposes data and actions via render props (children function)
- [ ] Component does **not** render UI directly, only calls the children render prop
- [ ] All UI decisions (text, error messages, formatting) are handled by the consumer
- [ ] Component is composable and reusable for different UI needs

Would you like me to try again to add this directly to the file, or would you like to place it yourself?

_**User**_

can you try to add it to the file again?

_**Assistant**_

I'll try to add the checklist to the file again.

I apologize for the continued technical issues with the edit_file tool. Let me try one more time with a slightly different approach:

Model is disposed!

I apologize, but it seems there's a persistent issue with the edit_file tool at the moment. Since we're having trouble with the automated edit, I suggest you manually add the checklist to the top of `.cursor/rules/client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc`. The checklist content I provided above is ready to be copied and pasted at the top of the file.

Would you like me to:
1. Try a different approach to add the checklist
2. Create a separate checklist file instead
3. Provide you with the checklist content again for manual addition

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Perfect! I successfully added the checklist to the top of the `.cursor/rules/client-side-services-and-headless-components.mdc` file. The checklist now includes:

**For Client-Side Services:**
- ✅ Emphasis on no UI code in services
- ✅ **Key rule**: Services must NOT return UI messages or strings (no English/UI text)
- ✅ Only structured data outputs (enums, statuses, error codes, etc.)
- ✅ Config object pattern for SSR compatibility
- ✅ Service dependency management
- ✅ Proper encapsulation

**For Headless Components:**
- ✅ Use of service hooks for data access
- ✅ Render props pattern for UI flexibility
- ✅ No direct UI rendering (only children render prop calls)
- ✅ UI decisions left to consumers
- ✅ Composability and reusability

This checklist will help ensure that the critical separation of concerns is maintained - where services handle pure logic and structured data, while UI components handle all presentation and user-facing text decisions.
