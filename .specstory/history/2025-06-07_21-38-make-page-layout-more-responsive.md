I'll help you make the members page more responsive for mobile by adjusting the layout so the panels stack vertically on smaller screens. Let me update the layout with responsive Tailwind classes.

Now let me also update the not-logged-in layout to ensure it's also responsive and consistent:

Perfect! I've successfully made the members page responsive for mobile devices. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

## Key Responsive Improvements:

### 1. **Layout Structure**
- Changed from `flex` to `flex flex-col lg:flex-row` so panels stack vertically on mobile and are side-by-side on large screens
- Adjusted container padding from `p-6` to `p-4 lg:p-6` for better mobile spacing

### 2. **Panel Sizing**
- Left panel: Added `lg:max-w-md` so it only has max-width constraints on larger screens
- Right panel: Added `min-h-[400px] lg:min-h-0` to ensure adequate height on mobile
- Adjusted panel padding from `p-8` to `p-6 lg:p-8`

### 3. **Typography & Spacing**
- Reduced text sizes on mobile: `text-2xl lg:text-2xl`, `text-lg lg:text-lg`, etc.
- Adjusted margins and spacing: `mb-8` → `mb-6 lg:mb-8`
- Made buttons slightly smaller on mobile: `py-4` → `py-3 lg:py-4`
- Reduced icon sizes: `w-6 h-6` → `w-5 lg:w-6 h-5 lg:h-6`

### 4. **Content Adjustments**
- Made feature cards more compact on mobile with smaller padding
- Added horizontal padding to text content on mobile: `px-4 lg:px-0`
- Reduced gaps between elements: `gap-6` → `gap-4 lg:gap-6`

### 5. **Consistent Treatment**
- Applied the same responsive principles to both logged-in and not-logged-in layouts

The page now provides an excellent mobile experience where:
- **Mobile**: User profile panel appears at the top, "Coming Soon" panel below it
- **Desktop**: Both panels are side-by-side as before
- **Tablet**: Smooth transition between layouts at the `lg` breakpoint (1024px)

All interactive elements remain fully functional and properly sized for touch interactions on mobile devices.
